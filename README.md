MLP CCG in video game form. Written in C++.

In this project, only the server is actively being worked on. The client is merely a connection tester. A separate client is being developed in Java by a friend to speed up development. Eventually I may work on the C++ client again.

Progress
--------
* Networking framework - Complete
* Lobby system - In progress
* The game itself - Not started
